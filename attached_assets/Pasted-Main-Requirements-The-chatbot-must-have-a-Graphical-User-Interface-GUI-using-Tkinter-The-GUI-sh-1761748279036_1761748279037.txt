Main Requirements

The chatbot must have a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter.

The GUI should be visually attractive with:

Pleasant background colors (preferably a mix of green, blue, and earthy tones to match the mangrove theme).

A chat window with smooth scrolling, animated typing effect, and color-coded messages (different colors for user and bot messages).

A mangrove forest background image or small bot icon/logo related to nature.

Simple fade-in or text-typing animation when the chatbot replies.

The chatbot should simulate a real conversation, where the user can type a message and the bot replies in the chat area.

It should answer only questions related to Mangrove Forests, including:

Flora (plant species, adaptations, etc.)

Fauna (animals, birds, and marine species)

Economic importance (timber, honey, coastal protection, etc.)

Tourism (eco-tourism, sightseeing, photography)

Ecological benefits (carbon storage, erosion prevention, biodiversity)

The chatbot should have a built-in knowledge base (dictionary or JSON) containing short, factual, easy-to-understand answers about mangrove forests.

If a user asks a question not related to Mangrove Forests, the chatbot must politely decline with responses like:

“I’m sorry, I can only answer questions about mangrove forests.”

“Please ask me something related to mangroves, such as their plants, animals, or ecological importance.”

Include randomized greetings (“Hi! 🌿 I’m MANGO, your Mangrove Forest Chatbot!”) and farewells (“Goodbye! Thanks for learning about mangroves 🌱”).

The chatbot should run until the user closes the window or types “bye”, “exit”, or “quit”.

Add clear comments in the code explaining:

GUI design

Event handling (user input, bot output)

Knowledge base

Keyword detection (how the bot decides if the question is relevant)

Animation or delay logic

The code must be beginner-friendly, self-contained, and run without external API keys — only use standard Python libraries (tkinter, random, time, re, etc.).

Finally, include a sample conversation output showing:

A few relevant questions (e.g., “What plants grow in mangrove forests?”)

A few off-topic questions (e.g., “Who is the president of India?”)

How the chatbot politely responds in both cases.

Bonus (if possible): Add a background image or small icon in the top corner and ensure the window is resizable and centered on screen.
